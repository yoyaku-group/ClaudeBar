# Release Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the GitHub secrets required for automated releases of ClaudeBar.

## Overview

The GitHub release workflow requires one repository secret:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SPARKLE_EDDSA_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key matching `SUPublicEDKey` |

Apple signing material stays in the trusted Mac runner's Keychain instead of
being duplicated into GitHub. The runner must expose a `Developer ID
Application` identity and the notarytool profile `YOYAKU-NOTARY`.

The workflow also requires the repository-authorized self-hosted runner labels
`self-hosted`, `macos`, `arm64`, and `yoyaku-macos-ci`. GitHub-hosted runners
are deliberately unsupported so the organization Actions budget stays at
zero.

The five App Store Connect/MAS secrets documented by
`appstore-release.yml` are separate and are not consumed by the direct GitHub
release workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- macOS with Keychain Access
- Access to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account)
- Access to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)

---

## Part 1: Developer ID Application Certificate

This certificate is used to sign the app for distribution outside the Mac App
Store. It must be installed in the self-hosted runner's login Keychain. The P12
steps below are for backup or runner migration; the release workflow does not
upload the P12 to GitHub.

### Step 1.1: Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

1. Open **Keychain Access** on your Mac
2. Go to **Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority**
3. Fill in:
   - **User Email Address**: Your email
   - **Common Name**: Your name
   - **CA Email Address**: Leave empty
   - **Request is**: Select **Saved to disk**
4. Click **Continue** and save the `.certSigningRequest` file

### Step 1.2: Create the Certificate in Apple Developer Portal

1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list
2. Click the **+** button to create a new certificate
3. Select **Developer ID Application** under "Software"
4. Click **Continue**
5. Upload the CSR file you created in Step 1.1
6. Click **Continue**
7. Download the certificate (`.cer` file)

### Step 1.3: Install the Certificate

1. Double-click the downloaded `.cer` file
2. It will be added to your **login** keychain in Keychain Access
3. Verify: Open Keychain Access → **My Certificates** → look for `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)`

### Step 1.4: Export as .p12

1. In Keychain Access, go to **My Certificates**
2. Find `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)`
   - It should have a **▶ disclosure triangle** showing a private key underneath
3. Click on the **certificate** (not the key)
4. Go to **File → Export Items** (or right-click → Export)
5. Choose **Personal Information Exchange (.p12)** format
6. Save the file and **enter a password** when prompted
7. Remember this password - you'll need it for `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`

> **Troubleshooting**: If you can only export as `.cer` (not `.p12`), the private key is missing. See [Certificate Troubleshooting](#certificate-troubleshooting) below.

### Step 1.5: Base64 Encode the .p12

```bash
base64 -i /path/to/certificate.p12 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
```

This copies the base64-encoded certificate to your clipboard.

### Step 1.6: Verify the trusted runner

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
xcrun notarytool history --keychain-profile YOYAKU-NOTARY
```

Both commands must succeed under the same macOS account that runs the GitHub
Actions service.

---

## Part 2: App Store Connect API Key

This key is used for notarizing the app with Apple.

### Step 2.1: Create an API Key

1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api
2. Click **Keys** tab (or **Generate API Key** if first time)
3. Click the **+** button to create a new key
4. Enter a **Name** (e.g., "GitHub Actions")
5. Select **Developer** access role
6. Click **Generate**

### Step 2.2: Download and Note the Details

After creating the key:

1. **Download the API Key** (`.p8` file)
   - ⚠️ **Important**: You can only download this ONCE! Save it securely.
2. Note the **Key ID** (e.g., `6X3CMK22CY`)
3. Note the **Issuer ID** at the top of the page (UUID format like `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`)

### Step 2.3: Base64 Encode the .p8

```bash
base64 -i /path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
```

### Step 2.4: Add to GitHub Secrets

Add these three secrets:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8` | The base64-encoded .p8 content |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID` | The Key ID (e.g., `6X3CMK22CY`) |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` | The Issuer ID (UUID) |

---

## Part 3: Verify Your Setup

### Verify the .p12 Certificate

Use the verification script:

```bash
./scripts/verify-p12.sh /path/to/certificate.p12
```

Expected output:
```
PASS: P12 file is valid
PASS: Found 1 certificate(s)
PASS: Found 1 private key(s)
PASS: Certificate is 'Developer ID Application' type
PASS: Certificate is valid for XXX more days
SUCCESS: P12 file contains both certificate and private key
```

### Verify the .p8 API Key

```bash
# Check the file looks correct
head -1 /path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8
# Should output: -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

tail -1 /path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8
# Should output: -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### Verify GitHub Release Secret

Your repository secrets should look like:

![GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repository-settings-secrets.png)

- `SPARKLE_EDDSA_PRIVATE_KEY` ✓

---

## Part 4: Create a Release

Once all secrets and the self-hosted runner are configured, follow this
workflow to create a release.

### Step 1: Write Release Notes in CHANGELOG.md

Before creating a release, update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes for this version:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- New feature X that does Y
- Better quota visualization

### Changed
- Improved performance of quota refresh

### Fixed
- Memory leak when switching providers
```

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/):
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Deprecated` - Features to be removed
- `### Removed` - Removed features
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Security` - Security fixes

### Step 2: Commit the Changelog

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: add release notes for v1.0.0"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Dispatch the Commit-Bound Release

The checked-in `CFBundleShortVersionString` and matching CHANGELOG section are
authoritative. Dispatch through the guarded wrapper with the exact `main` SHA:

```bash
RELEASE_SHA="$(git rev-parse main)"
gha-safe dispatch \
  --repo yoyaku-group/ClaudeBar \
  --workflow release.yml \
  --ref main \
  --expected-sha "$RELEASE_SHA" \
  --apply
```

The workflow re-resolves `main`, refuses any SHA drift, creates the matching
tag and GitHub release, signs and notarizes the app and DMG, emits checksums and
provenance, and publishes the signed Sparkle appcast.

Tag pushes remain supported for maintainers, but are subject to the same exact
`main`, version, credentials, signing, and provenance checks.

### Legacy tag examples

**Option A: Tag-based Release**

```bash
# Stable release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Beta release
git tag v1.0.0-beta.1
git push origin v1.0.0-beta.1

# Alpha or release candidate
git tag v2.0.0-alpha.1
git tag v2.0.0-rc.1
```

Do not use the GitHub UI's generic **Run workflow** button: `gha-safe` performs
the organization budget check and supplies the immutable `expected_sha` input.

### How Release Notes Flow

```
CHANGELOG.md (you write here)
       │
       ▼
extract-changelog.sh (extracts version section)
       │
       ├──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
       ▼                  ▼                  ▼
GitHub Release     appcast.xml        In-app updates
(What's New)       (Sparkle feed)     (shown to users)
```

The CI pipeline automatically:
1. Extracts release notes for your version from `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Includes them in the GitHub Release under "What's New"
3. Includes them in `appcast.xml` for Sparkle auto-updates

### Supported Version Formats

| Format | Example | Release Type |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `X.Y.Z` | `1.0.0` | Stable |
| `X.Y.Z-beta` | `1.0.0-beta` | Pre-release |
| `X.Y.Z-beta.N` | `1.0.0-beta.3` | Pre-release |
| `X.Y.Z-alpha.N` | `2.0.0-alpha.1` | Pre-release |
| `X.Y.Z-rc.N` | `2.0.0-rc.1` | Pre-release |

Pre-releases are automatically flagged on GitHub and won't appear as the "latest" release.

### What the CI Does

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Build the app for Intel and Apple Silicon
2. Sign with your Developer ID certificate
3. Notarize with Apple
4. Extract release notes from CHANGELOG.md
5. Create a GitHub release with DMG and ZIP
6. Update appcast.xml for Sparkle auto-updates
7. Mark as pre-release if version contains `-`

> **Note:** Homebrew Cask updates happen automatically! BrewTestBot monitors GitHub releases and creates PRs to update the cask every ~3 hours. No manual action needed.

---

## Part 5: Beta Channel Updates

ClaudeBar uses Sparkle's channel feature to support beta updates. Users can opt into beta releases via Settings.

### How Beta Channels Work

1. **Appcast Structure**: The appcast maintains BOTH the latest stable AND latest beta versions:
   ```xml
   <channel>
       <item>  <!-- Latest beta (if any) -->
           <sparkle:channel>beta</sparkle:channel>
           ...
       </item>
       <item>  <!-- Latest stable -->
           <!-- No channel tag -->
           ...
       </item>
   </channel>
   ```

2. **Client-Side Filtering**:
   - **Beta OFF**: Sparkle only shows items WITHOUT `<sparkle:channel>` tag (stable only)
   - **Beta ON**: Sparkle shows items with channel=beta AND items without channel tag

3. **Version Comparison**: Sparkle compares `sparkle:version` (build number), not version strings. Build numbers always increase across all releases.

### Version Update Scenarios

The following table documents all supported update scenarios:

| # | User Version | Appcast Contains | Beta Setting | Expected Result | Explanation |
|---|--------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.0 only | Either | No update | Already on latest |
| 2 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.1-beta + 1.0.0 | ON | Get 1.0.1-beta | Beta enabled, newer beta available |
| 3 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.1-beta + 1.0.0 | OFF | No update | Beta filtered out, already on latest stable |
| 4 | 1.0.1-beta | 1.0.1 + 1.0.1-beta | Either | Get 1.0.1 | Stable has higher build number, always preferred |
| 5 | 1.0.1 | 1.0.2-beta + 1.0.1 | ON | Get 1.0.2-beta | Beta enabled, newer beta available |
| 6 | 1.0.1 | 1.0.2-beta + 1.0.1 | OFF | No update | Beta filtered out, already on latest stable |
| 7 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.2-beta + 1.0.1 | OFF | Get 1.0.1 | Beta filtered out, but stable 1.0.1 available |
| 8 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.2-beta + 1.0.1 | ON | Get 1.0.2-beta | Both visible, beta is newest |

### Key Behaviors

1. **Stable always has higher build number than its beta**: When releasing 1.0.1 stable after 1.0.1-beta, the stable gets a higher build number (e.g., 102 vs 101). This ensures beta users automatically upgrade to stable.

2. **Appcast retains both versions**: The `update-appcast.sh` script maintains both latest stable and latest beta, ensuring:
   - Stable users always see stable updates (even when betas exist)
   - Beta users see both and get the newest version

3. **No downgrade from stable to beta**: Since stable versions have higher build numbers than their corresponding betas, Sparkle won't offer a beta "upgrade" to a stable user on the same version.

### Release Workflow Examples

**Scenario A: Regular stable release**
```
1. v1.0.0 stable → appcast: [1.0.0]
2. v1.0.1 stable → appcast: [1.0.1]
   All users get 1.0.1
```

**Scenario B: Beta then stable**
```
1. v1.0.0 stable  → appcast: [1.0.0]
2. v1.0.1-beta    → appcast: [1.0.1-beta, 1.0.0]
   Beta users: get 1.0.1-beta
   Stable users: stay on 1.0.0
3. v1.0.1 stable  → appcast: [1.0.1, 1.0.1-beta]
   All users: get 1.0.1 (higher build number)
```

**Scenario C: Multiple betas**
```
1. v1.0.0 stable  → appcast: [1.0.0]
2. v1.0.1-beta.1  → appcast: [1.0.1-beta.1, 1.0.0]
3. v1.0.1-beta.2  → appcast: [1.0.1-beta.2, 1.0.0]
   Beta users: upgrade to 1.0.1-beta.2
   Stable users: stay on 1.0.0
4. v1.0.1 stable  → appcast: [1.0.1, 1.0.1-beta.2]
   All users: get 1.0.1
```

## Part 6: Homebrew Cask (Automatic)

ClaudeBar is available on [Homebrew Cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/claudebar) and **updates automatically**.

### How It Works

The cask has a `livecheck` block that monitors GitHub releases. Homebrew's **BrewTestBot** automatically:
1. Detects new releases on GitHub every ~3 hours
2. Downloads the DMG and calculates SHA256
3. Creates a PR to update the cask formula
4. Merges it after CI passes

**No manual action is required** for Homebrew updates.

### Checking Homebrew Status

After releasing a new version, you can check the cask status:

```bash
# Check current Homebrew version
brew info --cask claudebar

# See the cask formula
brew cat claudebar
```

The Homebrew version typically updates within a few hours of a GitHub release.

### Manual Update (If Needed)

In rare cases where the automatic update doesn't work:

```bash
# Create a PR to update the cask
brew bump-cask-pr claudebar
```

Note: This will fail if BrewTestBot has already created a PR.

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Troubleshooting

#### "Cannot export as .p12" - Only .cer option available

The private key is not associated with the certificate. This happens when:
- The certificate was created on a different Mac
- The private key was deleted

**Solution A**: Find the original Mac where the CSR was created and export from there.

**Solution B**: Create a new certificate:
1. Revoke the old certificate in Apple Developer Portal
2. Create a new CSR on your current Mac
3. Create a new Developer ID Application certificate
4. Export the new certificate as .p12

#### Certificate and key are separate in Keychain

If you see the certificate and private key as separate items:

1. Export the certificate as `.cer`
2. Export the private key as `.p12`
3. Combine them using the script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/combine-cert-key.sh cert.cer key.p12 combined.p12
   ```

#### "0 valid identities found" in GitHub Actions

The certificate chain is incomplete. Make sure:
- You're using a **Developer ID Application** certificate (not Mac Developer or Apple Distribution)
- The .p12 contains both the certificate AND private key

### Notarization Troubleshooting

#### "invalidPrivateKeyContents"

The API key is corrupted or incorrectly encoded.

1. Re-download the .p8 file from App Store Connect (if you still can)
2. Re-encode: `base64 -i AuthKey_XXX.p8 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy`
3. Update the `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8` secret

#### "Invalid issuer" or authentication errors

Check that:
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID` matches the Key ID exactly
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` is the Issuer ID (UUID), not the Key ID
- The API key has **Developer** or **Admin** role
