# Changelog

All notable changes to ClaudeBar will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.4.58] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- Bug fixes and improvements.

---

## [0.4.57] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- Bug fixes and improvements.

---

## [0.4.56] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Mistral provider backed by Vibe session logs for quota monitoring.

### Fixed
- Mistral probe now uses Vibe's `session_total_llm_tokens` and `session_cost` fields for accurate usage tracking.

---

## [0.4.55] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Bug fixes and improvements.

---

## [0.4.54] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Bug fixes and improvements.

---

## [0.4.53] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Claude account info empty on CLI v2.1.79+**: The Claude CLI now uses a tabbed TUI where account info (email, organization) is on the Status tab, not the Usage tab. The probe now reads account info from `~/.claude.json` (`oauthAccount`) as a fallback, so the account card displays correctly without extra CLI calls.

### Refactored
- **Extract `ClaudeAccountInfoResolver`**: Account info resolution logic extracted from `ClaudeUsageProbe` into a dedicated `ClaudeAccountInfoResolver` that reads `~/.claude.json` → `oauthAccount`. Introduced `AccountInfo` domain value object with `displayName`, `isEmpty`, and `initialLetter` computed properties. Improves SRP and testability — the probe now delegates account identity resolution instead of owning it.

---

## [0.4.52] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- Bug fixes and improvements.

---

## [0.4.51] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- Bug fixes and improvements.

---

## [0.4.50] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Extensions System**: Raycast-style user extensions for custom provider monitoring. Drop a folder with a `manifest.json` and probe scripts into `~/.claudebar/extensions/` to add your own provider. Each extension defines composable sections (`quotaGrid`, `metricsRow`, `dailyUsage`, `costUsage`, `statusBanner`, `healthCheck`) with per-section probe commands and independent refresh intervals. Probe scripts can be any language (bash, python, swift) — just output JSON to stdout. Extensions auto-register as providers with custom branding (icon, colors) and appear in the provider pills alongside built-in providers. See `docs/features/extensions.md` for the full spec and example.
- **Built-in Health Check for Extensions**: Extensions can now define a `healthCheck` section with a URL endpoint — no probe script needed. ClaudeBar pings the URL and renders Status (UP/DOWN with HTTP code) and Latency cards automatically. Configure via `"probe": { "builtIn": "healthCheck", "url": "https://..." }` in `manifest.json`.

---

## [0.4.49] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Custom Web Card per Provider**: Configure a custom URL for any provider to display an embedded web page as an additional card below the quota cards. Useful for third-party dashboards like [claude.owo.nz](https://claude.owo.nz/). Set via Settings → Providers → Custom Card URL field. The page is rendered inline with WKWebView, scaled to fit the card, with an "open in browser" button.

### Fixed
- **SwiftTerm Metal duplicate build error**: Resolved the `Unexpected duplicate tasks: MetalLink` build failure caused by Tuist adding `Shaders.metal` to both Sources and Resources build phases. Fixed via `EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES` in Tuist package settings, eliminating the need for the post-generation fix script.

---

## [0.4.48] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Burn Rate Warnings**: New pace-aware warning system that alerts based on consumption rate rather than fixed usage thresholds. Instead of warning at arbitrary percentages (e.g., 57% used = warning), it calculates whether you're on track to exhaust your quota before the period resets. For example, 57% used with 85% of the session elapsed is healthy (burn rate 0.67), while 53% used with only 8.5% of the week elapsed is a real warning (burn rate 6.2). Configurable threshold multiplier (1.2x–3.0x) in Settings. Disabled by default — opt in via Settings → Burn Rate Warnings. Critical (<20%) and depleted (0%) thresholds remain absolute as a safety net. ([#151](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/issues/151))

---

## [0.4.47] - 2026-03-12

---

## [0.4.46] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Alibaba Coding Plan Provider**: Monitor your Alibaba Coding Plan usage quotas directly from the menu bar. Supports three quota windows — 5-hour session, weekly, and monthly — with reset times and progress tracking. Authenticate via API key or browser cookies (auto-extract with SweetCookieKit or paste manually). Supports both International (`modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com`) and China Mainland (`bailian.console.aliyun.com`) regions.

---

## [0.4.45] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Daily Usage Cards Toggle**: New setting to show/hide daily usage report cards (API Cost, Token Usage, Working Time) in the menu bar. Useful for users who don't use the Claude API or prefer a cleaner view. Toggle in Settings → Display.

### Improved
- **Settings Storage Migration**: Migrated all settings from UserDefaults to a unified JSON file (`~/.claudebar/settings.json`). Settings are now backed by `JSONSettingsRepository` with dot-notation key paths, making them easier to inspect, debug, and test. Credentials (GitHub token, MiniMax API key) remain in UserDefaults for now.
- **Settings Architecture**: `AppSettings` now exposes typed provider accessors (`settings.claude`, `settings.copilot`, etc.) via ISP sub-protocols, replacing direct `UserDefaultsProviderSettingsRepository.shared` calls throughout the codebase.

### Fixed
- **Daily Usage Report**: Fixed daily usage cards not appearing when today's usage is $0.00 but yesterday has data. The report now shows whenever either today or the previous day has usage data.

### Technical
- Added `JSONSettingsStore` for thread-safe JSON file I/O with nested dot-notation key paths
- Added `JSONSettingsRepository` implementing all settings protocols (`AppSettingsRepository`, `ClaudeSettingsRepository`, `CopilotSettingsRepository`, `BedrockSettingsRepository`, `KimiSettingsRepository`, `MiniMaxSettingsRepository`, `HookSettingsRepository`, etc.)
- Added `AppSettingsRepository` domain protocol with `@Mockable` for testability
- Refactored `AppSettings` to use `JSONSettingsRepository` as private backing store with typed protocol accessors
- Added `showDailyUsageCards` setting end-to-end (toggle → AppSettings → JSONSettingsRepository → settings.json)
- 87+ new settings tests (JSONSettingsStore: 18, JSONSettingsRepository app: 20, provider: 29)
- Reorganized provider tests into subfolder structure (`Tests/DomainTests/Provider/Claude/`, `Copilot/`, etc.)
- Added `AlibabaUsageProbe` with console RPC and API key fetch strategies, resilient DataV2 envelope parsing
- Added `AlibabaProvider`, `AlibabaRegion`, `AlibabaCookieSource` domain models
- Added `AlibabaSettingsRepository` sub-protocol (ISP) for region, cookie source, and credentials
- 20 new Alibaba provider tests (17 parsing + 3 probe behavior)

## [0.4.44] - 2026-03-11

---

## [0.4.43] - 2026-03-11

---

## [0.4.43] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Daily Usage Report Cards**: See your daily Claude Code cost, token usage, and working time right in the menu bar. ClaudeBar now analyzes your local session files (`~/.claude/projects/`) and displays three new cards below the quota cards:
  - **Cost Usage** — Estimated daily spend based on token counts and Anthropic's published model pricing (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
  - **Token Usage** — Total tokens consumed (input, output, and cache)
  - **Working Time** — Time spent in Claude Code sessions, estimated from message timestamps
  - Each card shows a comparison delta vs the previous day (e.g., "Vs Mar 10 -$27.47 (4.9%)")
  - Only scans recently modified files for fast performance even with thousands of sessions

## [0.4.42] - 2026-03-09

---

## [0.4.41] - 2026-03-08

---

## [0.4.40] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Cursor Enterprise Plan Support**: Fixed quota monitoring for enterprise accounts where `limitType` is `"team"`. Previously the parser always threw `"No usage data found"` because `individualUsage.plan.limit` is `0` on enterprise plans. The parser now falls back to `breakdown.total` for the individual credit limit and reads `teamUsage.onDemand` as an additional team quota source (reported in [#136](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/issues/136)).

## [0.4.38] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Claude Setup-Token Support**: ClaudeBar now recognizes users who authenticate via `claude setup-token`. The app loads the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable as a credential source and gracefully falls back to stored credentials (file/keychain) that have full scope, so quota monitoring continues to work seamlessly regardless of how you authenticated (contributed by [@brendandebeasi](https://github.com/brendandebeasi) in [#129](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/pull/129)).

### Fixed
- **MiniMax Region Support**: MiniMax settings now include a region selector (International vs. China) to point to the correct API endpoint. Previously the app hardcoded the China-region URL (`minimaxi.com`), preventing international users from fetching quota data. Select your region in Settings → MiniMax to fix connection issues (contributed by [@BryanQQYue](https://github.com/BryanQQYue) in [#125](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/issues/125)).

## [0.4.37] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- **Codex process leak**: Fixed a critical bug where ClaudeBar would spawn a new `codex app-server` process on every usage refresh without ever terminating it. Over time this caused thousands of orphaned processes that degraded system performance (reported in [#113](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/issues/113)). The locally-created `ProcessRPCTransport` is now properly closed after each RPC call via `defer`.

## [0.4.36] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Cursor Support**: Monitor your [Cursor](https://cursor.com) IDE subscription usage (included requests and on-demand spending) directly from the menu bar. Supports Pro, Business, Free, and Ultra plans with automatic tier detection.
  - Reads auth token from Cursor's local SQLite database automatically
  - Calls `cursor.com/api/usage-summary` for real-time usage data
  - Displays monthly included requests and on-demand usage
- **Overview Mode AppLogo**: The header now displays the ClaudeBar logo when Overview mode is enabled, instead of the last selected provider's icon.

### Fixed
- **Cursor API parsing**: Fixed parsing to match the real Cursor API response structure (`individualUsage.plan` and `individualUsage.onDemand`).

### Technical
- Added `CursorProvider` domain model following Kiro/AmpCode pattern
- Added `CursorUsageProbe` with HTTP API + SQLite token extraction
- Added Cursor visual identity (icon, brand color, gradient)
- 15+ parsing tests covering all Cursor response formats

## [0.4.35] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Kiro Support**: Monitor your [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) (by AWS) AI coding assistant usage quotas via `kiro-cli`. Displays weekly bonus credits and monthly regular credits with reset time tracking.
  - Install with `uv tool install kiro-cli` and authenticate via Kiro IDE
  - Automatically parses usage data from `kiro-cli /usage` output

### Fixed
- **MiniMax Branding**: Renamed "MiniMaxi" to "MiniMax" for correct branding consistency (#116).

### Technical
- Added `KiroProvider` domain model and `KiroUsageProbe` with CLI output parsing
- Added `SimpleCLIExecutor` for lightweight Process-based CLI execution
- Migrated Kiro tests from XCTest to Swift Testing

## [0.4.34] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **MiniMax Support**: Monitor your [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io) Coding Plan usage quota directly from the menu bar. Queries the MiniMax API for remaining coding plan credits.
  - Configurable API key and environment variable support in Settings
  - Test connection button to verify API key

### Fixed
- **Docs**: Corrected release build command in CLAUDE.md and README (`-C Release` → `-configuration Release`).

### Technical
- Added `MiniMaxiProvider` domain model with API-based quota tracking
- Added `MiniMaxiUsageProbe` querying `/v1/api/openplatform/coding_plan/remains`
- Added `MiniMaxiSettingsRepository` sub-protocol for API key and env var configuration
- Parsing and probe unit tests

## [0.4.33] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Claude Code Session Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of Claude Code sessions via hooks. When Claude Code is running, ClaudeBar shows session status directly in the menu bar and popover:
  - **Menu bar indicator**: A terminal icon appears next to the quota icon with phase-colored status (green = active, blue = subagents working, orange = stopped)
  - **Session card**: Detailed session info in the popover showing phase, task count, active subagents, duration, and working directory
  - **System notifications**: Get notified when a session starts ("Claude Code Started") and finishes ("Claude Code Finished — Completed 3 tasks in 2m 5s")
- **Hook Settings**: New "Claude Code Hooks" section in Settings with a single toggle to enable/disable. Automatically installs/uninstalls hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Server starts/stops reactively when the toggle changes.
- **Copilot Internal API Probe**: New dual probe mode for GitHub Copilot, supporting Business and Enterprise plans where the Billing API returns 404. Switchable in Settings between "Billing API" (default) and "Copilot API" (`copilot_internal/user`) modes.

### Fixed
- **HookHTTPServer deadlock**: Removed `queue.sync` calls inside NWListener callbacks that already run on the same serial queue, preventing a crash on startup.
- **Hook format**: Updated hook installer to use Claude Code's new matcher-based format (`{"matcher": ".*", "hooks": [...]}`) instead of the deprecated flat format.

### Technical
- Added `SessionEvent`, `ClaudeSession`, and `SessionMonitor` (`@MainActor`) domain models for session lifecycle tracking
- Added `HookHTTPServer` using Network.framework (`NWListener`) for localhost-only event reception on port 19847
- Added `SessionEventParser` for parsing Claude Code hook JSON payloads
- Added `HookInstaller` with atomic writes and corruption-safe JSON handling
- Added `PortDiscovery` for writing/reading `~/.claude/claudebar-hook-port`
- Added `HookSettingsRepository` protocol and JSON-backed implementation
- Added `CopilotProbeMode` enum, `CopilotInternalAPIProbe`, and dual probe support in `CopilotProvider`
- Added `com.apple.security.network.server` entitlement for `NWListener`
- Added `AppLog.hooks` logging category
- Extracted `ClaudeSession.Phase.label` and `.color` extensions to deduplicate phase display logic
- Added `HookConstants.defaultPort` as single source of truth for port 19847

## [0.4.32] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Overview Mode**: New "Overview" toggle in Settings to display all enabled providers at once in a single scrollable view. Ideal for juggling multiple AI assistants (Claude + Codex + Kimi + ...) throughout the day — see all your quotas at a glance without switching between pills.

### Technical
- Added `overviewModeEnabled` setting to `AppSettings`
- Added scrollable overview layout with per-provider sections reusing existing stat cards, capped at 80% screen height

## [0.4.31] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Kimi Support**: Monitor your [Kimi](https://www.kimi.com/code/console) AI coding assistant usage quota directly from the menu bar. Displays weekly quota and 5-hour session rate limit with automatic tier detection (Andante/Moderato/Allegretto).
- **Kimi Dual Probe Mode**: Kimi now supports both CLI and API modes, switchable in Settings:
  - **CLI Mode (Recommended)**: Launches the interactive `kimi` CLI and sends `/usage`. No Full Disk Access needed — just install `kimi` CLI (`uv tool install kimi-cli`).
  - **API Mode**: Calls the Kimi API directly using browser cookie authentication via [SweetCookieKit](https://github.com/steipete/SweetCookieKit). Requires Full Disk Access to read browser cookies.
- **Provider Icon**: New Kimi icon with blue/cyan branded styling in the provider list.

### Technical

- Added visual identity (icon, theme color, gradient) for Kimi provider
- Registered Kimi provider in `ClaudeBarApp` startup with both probes
- Comprehensive test coverage: CLI parsing tests (18), CLI probe behavior tests (6), API probe tests (8), provider domain tests (18)

## [0.4.28] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Amp Code Support**: Monitor your [Amp](https://ampcode.com) (by Sourcegraph) AI coding assistant usage quota directly from the menu bar. Automatically detects the `amp` CLI and displays your usage and plan tier.
- **Amp Tier Detection**: Automatically identifies your Amp subscription tier (Free, Pro, etc.) for accurate quota display.
- **Provider Icon**: New Amp icon with branded styling in the provider list.

### Improved
- **Privacy Protection**: Amp probe sanitizes personal information from log output to prevent PII leaks.
- **Probe Performance**: Optimized regex compilation in Amp probe for faster quota parsing.

### Technical
- Implemented `AmpCodeUsageProbe` with CLI output parsing and tier detection via regex
- Added `AmpCodeProvider` domain model with observable state and settings persistence
- Added visual identity (icon, theme color, gradient) for Amp provider
- Registered Amp provider in `ClaudeBarApp` startup
- Comprehensive test coverage for probe parsing (130+ lines), probe behavior (127+ lines), and tier detection

## [0.4.26] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Launch at Login**: New toggle in Settings to automatically start ClaudeBar when you log in to your Mac. Uses macOS native `SMAppService` — no helper app required.
- **Pace Tick Mark**: Visual tick mark below the consumption bar showing your expected usage pace. ([#96](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/pull/96) - thanks [@frankhommers](https://github.com/frankhommers)!)

### Fixed
- **Claude API Cost Display**: API cost is now correctly converted from cents to dollars in Claude API mode. ([#95](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/issues/95))

### Improved
- **README Screenshots**: Compressed screenshots from ~38 MB to ~2.8 MB for faster page loading on GitHub.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **Codex API Mode**: New alternative to RPC mode that fetches quota data directly via the ChatGPT backend API. Faster than RPC mode (no subprocess spawning), with automatic OAuth token refresh. Switch between modes in Settings → Codex Configuration.
- **Codex Configuration Card**: New settings panel to choose between RPC mode (default, uses `codex app-server` JSON-RPC) and API mode (direct HTTP API calls using OAuth credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json`).

### Improved
- **Codebase Organization**: Reorganized Infrastructure and Domain layers from mechanism-based grouping (`CLI/`, `Adapters/`, `AWS/`) to provider-based grouping (`Claude/`, `Codex/`, `Gemini/`, etc.), making it easier to find all files related to a specific provider.

### Technical
- Added `CodexAPIUsageProbe` calling `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with OAuth token refresh via `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token`
- Added `CodexCredentialLoader` for loading OAuth credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json`
- Added `CodexProbeMode` enum (`.rpc`, `.api`) and `CodexSettingsRepository` protocol for probe mode persistence
- Extended `CodexProvider` with dual probe support (RPC + API) and mode switching
- Reorganized `Sources/Infrastructure/` into provider-level folders (`Claude/`, `Codex/`, `Gemini/`, `Copilot/`, `Antigravity/`, `Zai/`, `Bedrock/`, `Shared/`)
- Reorganized `Sources/Domain/Provider/` and `Tests/InfrastructureTests/` to mirror the same provider-first structure

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **Remaining / Used Display Toggle**: Switch between "25% Remaining" and "75% Used" views for all quota cards. Choose whichever framing makes more sense for your workflow — see how much you have left, or how much you've consumed. Toggle in Settings → Quota Display.

### Technical
- Added `UsageDisplayMode` enum in Domain layer with `.remaining` and `.used` cases
- Added `displayPercent(mode:)` and `displayProgressPercent(mode:)` methods to `UsageQuota`
- Added `usageDisplayMode` to `AppSettings` (default: `.remaining`)
- Updated `WrappedStatCard` and `QuotaCardView` to use display mode for percentage and label
- Added "Quota Display" settings card with two-button toggle
- 12 new tests covering display mode enum, percent calculation, and progress bar behavior

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Claude API Mode**: New alternative to CLI mode that fetches quota data directly via Anthropic's OAuth API. Faster than CLI mode (no subprocess spawning), with automatic token refresh. Switch between modes in Settings → Claude Configuration.
- **Claude Configuration Card**: New settings panel to choose between CLI mode (default, uses `claude /usage` command) and API mode (direct HTTP API calls using OAuth credentials).
- **Copilot Manual Usage Override**: For users with organization-based Copilot subscriptions where API data isn't available, manually enter your usage from GitHub settings. Supports both request counts (e.g., "99") and percentages (e.g., "198%").
- **Copilot Monthly Limit Configuration**: Choose your Copilot plan tier (Free/Pro: 50, Business: 300, Enterprise: 1000, Pro+: 1500) for accurate quota calculations.
- **Over-Quota Display**: Negative percentages now display correctly when you've exceeded your quota limit (e.g., -98% when using 99 of 50 requests).

### Improved
- **Better Error Messages**: When Claude API session expires, shows user-friendly message: "Session expired. Run `claude` in terminal to log in again."
- **Gemini Quota Accuracy**: Falls back to any available GCP project when primary project isn't found, ensuring quota data is displayed.
- **Auto-Trust Probe Directory**: Automatically trusts the probe working directory when Claude CLI shows trust dialog, eliminating manual intervention.
- **CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR Support**: Respects custom Claude configuration directory for trust file location.

### Fixed
- **Copilot Dashboard URL**: Now links directly to GitHub Copilot features page for easier usage viewing.
- **Copilot Usage Period Reset**: Manual usage entries automatically clear when billing period changes.
- **Schema Validation**: Guards against unexpected config file schemas to prevent crashes.

### Technical

- Added `ProbeError.sessionExpired` case with user-friendly error description
- Migrated build system to Tuist for dependency management
- Updated aws-sdk-swift and SwiftTerm dependencies

## [0.3.15] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **AWS Bedrock Support**: Monitor your AWS Bedrock AI usage directly from the menu bar. Track daily costs, token counts, and per-model breakdowns for your Claude, Llama, and other Bedrock models. ([#75](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/pull/75) - thanks [@tomstetson](https://github.com/tomstetson)!)
- **Bedrock Usage Card**: New dedicated view showing daily costs, input/output token counts, and detailed per-model usage breakdown
- **Provider Icon**: New Bedrock provider icon with AWS orange theme for easy identification

### Improved
- **AWS SSO Authentication**: Full support for AWS SSO profile-based authentication using `SSOAWSCredentialIdentityResolver`, making it easy to use your existing AWS profiles
- **Cross-Region Inference**: Properly handles regional prefixes (us., eu., etc.) in model IDs for accurate pricing across regions
- **Model Pricing**: Added Claude Haiku 4.5 model pricing for accurate cost calculations

### Fixed
- **CloudWatch Period Calculation**: Fixed period calculation to be multiples of 60 seconds as required by CloudWatch API
- **CloudWatch Filters**: Removed problematic filters that could cause incomplete usage data

### Technical
- Implemented `BedrockUsageProbe` with CloudWatch metrics integration

- Created `BedrockUsageCard` SwiftUI view with cost and token breakdown display
- Extended visual identity system with Bedrock-specific colors and styling
- Added pricing normalization for cross-region inference model ID prefixes
- Bundled pricing data for Claude Haiku 4.5 model

## [0.3.12] - 2026-01-20

### Changed
- **Background Sync Disabled by Default**: Background sync is now disabled by default. Each Claude CLI spawn triggers a warmup session (even with zero prompts), and frequent background syncs can cause these sessions to stack up. The Claude Code team has addressed this in recent versions, so if you've updated to the latest Claude CLI, you can safely re-enable background sync in Settings → Background Sync.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **SwiftTerm Integration**: Added SwiftTerm terminal emulator library to properly render Claude CLI output. This fixes parsing issues with Claude Code v2.1.4+ which uses advanced terminal UI with cursor movements that previously corrupted captured output.

### Improved
- **Simplified Parsing**: Removed complex fuzzy matching and cursor movement heuristics. Terminal output is now properly rendered before parsing, producing clean text like a real terminal display.
- **Better Quota Accuracy**: Terminal rendering ensures "Current session" and other quota labels are parsed correctly even when the CLI uses cursor positioning to redraw the screen.

### Fixed
- **Sonnet Quota Display**: Fixed "Current week (Sonnet only)" being incorrectly labeled as "Opus" in the quota display. Sonnet and Opus quotas are now tracked and displayed separately.
- **Null Character Handling**: Fixed terminal buffer extraction to properly handle null characters from empty cells, which caused extracted text to include invisible padding.

### Technical
- Added SwiftTerm dependency (1.2.0+) for VT100/Xterm terminal emulation
- Created `TerminalRenderer` utility in `Sources/Infrastructure/Adapters/` that handles cursor movements, screen clearing, and ANSI escape sequences
- Replaced `stripANSICodes()` in `ClaudeUsageProbe` with `renderTerminalOutput()` using SwiftTerm
- Updated `Project.swift` to include SwiftTerm in Infrastructure target for Tuist builds
- Removed fuzzy regex matching (`matchesFuzzy`) - no longer needed with proper terminal rendering

## [0.3.4] - 2026-01-08

### Added
- **Background Sync**: Your quota data now syncs automatically in the background, so it's always fresh when you open the menu. No more waiting! Configure sync intervals (30s, 1min, 2min, or 5min) in Settings → Background Sync.
- **Fresh App Logo**: Updated app icon with a refreshed design.

### Improved
- **Better CLI Detection**: Fixed issues finding Claude, Codex, and other CLI tools on systems with custom shell configurations. The app now uses your login shell to properly resolve PATH ([#45](https://github.com/tddworks/ClaudeBar/issues/45)).

### Fixed
- **Update Window Focus**: The update dialog now properly comes to the front when checking for updates.

### Technical
- Added `backgroundSyncEnabled` and `backgroundSyncInterval` settings to `AppSettings`
- Implemented background sync lifecycle in `MenuContentView` with start/stop/restart controls
- Added Background Sync settings card to Settings UI with interval picker
- Uses existing `QuotaMonitor.startMonitoring()` infrastructure for efficient polling
- Added `shellPath()` to `InteractiveRunner` for accurate shell environment resolution

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Pluggable Theme System**: ClaudeBar now supports multiple visual themes with a protocol-based architecture. Switch themes instantly from Settings to match your workflow and preferences.
- **CLI Terminal Theme**: New monochrome, terminal-inspired theme for developers who prefer a classic command-line aesthetic. Features monospace fonts, green accents, and a retro terminal look.
- **Theme-Specific Menu Bar Icons**: Each theme can display its own custom menu bar icon, providing a cohesive visual experience across the entire app.

### Improved
- **Enhanced Christmas Theme**: Refreshed festive color palette with improved reds, greens, and golds. Updated gradients and glass effects for a more polished holiday feel.
- **Smoother UI**: Refined corner radius on cards and pills for a more consistent visual appearance across all themes.
- **Menu Width**: Adjusted menu content width for better readability.

### Fixed
- **Menu Bar Status Display**: The menu bar icon now correctly reflects the selected provider's status instead of showing incorrect state.

### Technical
- Introduced `AppThemeProvider` protocol for pluggable theme architecture
- Added `ThemeRegistry` for runtime theme management and discovery
- Created SwiftUI environment integration with `@Environment(\.appTheme)` support
- Implemented built-in themes: Dark, Light, CLI, Christmas, and System (auto-switching)
- Added `statusBarIconName` property to themes for custom menu bar icons
- Moved theme colors to static properties within theme structs for better encapsulation
- Added comprehensive theme system design documentation

## [0.2.15] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Claude API Billing Support**: Users with API Usage Billing accounts (pay-per-use) can now monitor their Claude usage. The app automatically detects billing plan type and uses the `/cost` command to display total cost and API duration when `/usage` is unavailable.
- **Z.ai Environment Variable Fallback**: Configure a custom environment variable for GLM authentication in Settings, useful when you have multiple API keys or non-standard setups.
- **Custom Z.ai Config Path**: Specify a custom path to your Z.ai configuration file if it's not in the default Claude Code settings location.
